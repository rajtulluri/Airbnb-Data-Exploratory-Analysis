Exploratory Data Analysis on the Airbnb Dataset. <br>
The dataset is available at this <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data>link</a>

The aim of this project is to analyse the dataset and answer these questions :-

   1.Which hosts are the busiest and why?
   2.What areas have more traffic than others and why is that the case?
   3.Are there any relationships between prices and number of reviews for a given listing?
