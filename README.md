# Airbnb-Data-Exploratory-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Airbnb Dataset. <br>
The dataset is available at this <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data>link</a>

The aim of this project is to analyse the dataset and answer these questions :-<br>

   1. Which hosts are the busiest and why?<br>
   2. What areas have more traffic than others and why is that the case?<br>
   3. Are there any relationships between prices and number of reviews for a given listing?<br>

In the notebook, there are detailed steps leading to the analysis and answering of these questions.
